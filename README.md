# Alt-Text-Frontend

A Next.js based website meant to showcase the [Alt-Text PyPi Package](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/alt-text).

## Features

Upon creating an account, the user will be able to upload Ebooks (either HTML or EPUB format) to which our servers will analyze it and generate descriptions for images lacking alt-text.

They can then use a dashboard to view, edit, and approve both the generated and already existing alt-text within the Ebook.

A user can create groups in which they can invite other users, allowing for multiple users to edit and approve the alt-text within the group's Ebooks.

## Getting Started

TBD

## Our Mission

The Alt-Text project is developed for the [Free Ebook Foundation](https://ebookfoundation.org/) as a Senior Design Project at [Stevens Institute of Technology](https://www.stevens.edu/).

As Ebooks become a more prominant way to consume written materials, it only becomes more important for them to be accessible to all people. Alternative text (aka alt-text) in Ebooks are used as a way for people to understand images in Ebooks if they are unable to use images as intended (e.g. a visual impaired person using a screen reader to read an Ebook).

While this feature exists, it is still not fully utilized and many Ebooks lack alt-text in some, or even all their images. To illustrate this, the [Gutenberg Project](https://gutenberg.org/), the creator of the Ebook and now a distributor of Public Domain Ebooks, have over 70,000 Ebooks in their collection and of those, there are about 170,000 images without alt-text.

The Alt-Text project's goal is to use the power of AI, Automation, and the Internet to craft a solution capable of automatically generating descriptions for images lacking alt-text in Ebooks, closing the accessibility gap and improving collections, such as the [Gutenberg Project](https://gutenberg.org/).
